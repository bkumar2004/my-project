In this experiment, I learned how to make a simple HTML form.
I added fields for name, email, and age.

I also learned how to use HTML to check the inputs like:

Name only letters (max 50 characters) uppercase, lowercase characters and max 50 characters only.
Email in correct format that is contaning '@' and proper mail domain.
Age only 1â€“99

This taught me how to make forms work properly on a website.
