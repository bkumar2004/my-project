The project was structured with only two main files inside the src folder:
- App.js – the parent component that renders the interface and imports the child component.
- BookManager.js – the main logic component that handles book data, search, add, and remove functionality.
- index.css - contains css styling 

Main concepts used:
useState for state management
Controlled form inputs
Array iteration and filtering
Event handling for search, add, and remove actions
