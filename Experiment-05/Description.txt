This project creates a basic Dynamic Product Filter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It includes a dropdown menu that lets users filter products by category. The product list updates live based on the selected category.

HTML (Basic Structure of the Webpage):
There are four main tags in the HTML code: <h2>, <select>, <div>, and <script>.

*<h2> tag
Displays the heading "Product List" at the top of the page.

*<select> tag
Has the id "categoryFilter" and includes options: All, Clothing, Electronics, and Books.
It allows users to choose a category to filter the product list.

*<div> tag
The <div> with id "productList" is where the filtered products are displayed dynamically.

*<script> tag:
 Contains JavaScript code that handles filtering logic and DOM updates.
Uses getElementById to access the dropdown and product list container.
An event listener is added to the dropdown that listens for "change" events.
Each time the user selects a category, the function filters and displays matching products.

Functional Highlights:

*Live Filtering:
Product list updates instantly when category changes â€” no page reload.

*DOM Manipulation:
Products are generated dynamically using JavaScript, not hardcoded in HTML.

*Event-Driven UI:
Uses change event listener for responsive interaction.

*Scalable Design:
Easy to add new categories or products by updating the array and dropdown.

*Separation of Concerns:
HTML handles structure, CSS handles styling, JavaScript handles logic.
