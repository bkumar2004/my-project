This project is a Canvas Drawing Tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to draw freehand sketches directly on a webpage, simulating a simple paint-like application.

 ->HTML Structure

The HTML defines the layout of the page. 
It includes a heading and a <canvas> element where all the drawing happens. 
The canvas has fixed dimensions of 800x500 pixels, and an external CSS and JavaScript file are linked to handle styling and functionality.

->Styling with CSS

 The CSS styles the webpage to look clean and user-friendly. 
 The entire page is centered both vertically and horizontally,
 the background is light gray for contrast, and the canvas has a white background with a black border to make the drawing area stand out. 
The cursor changes to a crosshair, giving a sketch-like feel.

->Drawing functionality with JavaScript

JavaScript makes the canvas interactive by handling mouse events:

Start Drawing: When the mouse button is pressed down (mousedown), a new path is created and drawing begins.

Continue Drawing: As the mouse moves (mousemove), lines are drawn in green with a stroke width of 2 pixels, following the cursorâ€™s path.

Stop Drawing: When the mouse button is released (mouseup) or the cursor leaves the canvas (mouseleave), the drawing stops and the path closes.

This logic ensures smooth and continuous freehand drawing.

Final Result

When opened in a browser, 
the project provides a digital sketchpad where users can draw freely.
 It feels like a lightweight paint tool and can be further enhanced by adding features like color selection, erasing, saving drawings, or adjustable line thickness.
